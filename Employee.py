# Program #4 Employee Class:
# Write a class Employee that holds the following data about an employee in attributes: name, ID number, department, and job title.

# Once you have written the class, write a program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data.

# Name	ID Number	Department	Job Title
# Susan Meyers	47899 	Accounting	Vice President
# Mark Jones	39119	IT	Programmer
# Joy Rogers	81774	Manufacturing	Engineer
# The program should store the data in the three objects, then display the data for each employee on the screen.
